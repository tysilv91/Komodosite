        <h1>Physical Description</h1>
      </div>
          <p class="lead">An average adult Komodo dragon typically weighs in around 150-200lbs and can grow to be 
          7' to 9'long. Their tough hides are plated with armoured scales,that function like chain-mail armor to protect
          them from threats. Their tails easily make up half of their body length, and can be used in a whip-like manner
          to either concuss or lacerate would be attackers. On the end of each foot are curved claws, perfect for holding onto
          large prey as well as tearing chunks apart from fresh caught meals. Komodo Dragon mouths are lined with 60, 1" long,
          serrated teeth.

          <h2>Island Giant</h2>
          </div>
          <p class="lead"> Komodo dragons are an excellent example of an evolutionary phenomenon called
           <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Island_gigantism"> Island Gigantism </a>. With no other large
           predators competing for food sources, the Komodo dragons have flourished as the dominant predators in their
           natural habitats, growing much larger than any other species of lizard anywhere else in the world. 
          </p>
          
          <div id="clear">
            <h2>Deadly Bite & Hunting</h2>
          </div>
          <p class="lead"> Compared to other predators, Komodo Dragons have a more limited range of senses. They can detect vibrations
          and hear sounds within a limited decible range, and while they have great sight distance and can see in color, they have 
          reletively weak night-vision, and trouble distinguishing stationary objects. Like all reptiles, they greatly depend on
          sense of smell and the ability to track and sense prey through tasting the air with their forked tongues, tracking prey
          from up to 6 miles away. </p>
          <p class="lead"> Perhaps a Komodo Dragon's most distiguishing hunting ability is its toxic bite. Over 57 strains of bacteria
          have been found to grow in the mouths of Komodo Dragons in the wild. Recent Studies have also discovered the existence of 
          "venom" glands in the animal, though it is debated to what extent this venom plays in the role of catching prey. Able to
          sprint up to 13 MPH when chasing prey, Komodo Dragons will often bite larger prey like boar or bison, and then, with the animal 
          infected from the bacterial-enchanced bite, simply follow their prey until infection sets in and it can no longer run.</p>
