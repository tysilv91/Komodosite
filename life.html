        <h1>Life Cycle</h1>
      </div>
          <p class="lead"> Mating Season for Komodo Dragons begins in the summer months between May and August. Males fight each
          other over female mates during this season. Females begin to lay eggs around September. Eggs are incubated for roughly 8
          months and ready to hatch by 
          spring. An average egg clutch contains 20 eggs, laid in covered nests dug out of the ground. Upon hatching, 
          Baby Komodos must fend for themselves, with no parent or family to guide them. Young Komodos will seek 
          refuge in trees away from cannibalistic adult dragons. A Komodo dragon will take approximately 3 to 5 years to reach full
          adult maturity, and can live for up to 50 years.</p>

            <h2>Behavior and Social Structures</h2>
          </div>
          
          <p class="lead"> Komodo dragons are solitary animals, only engaging with other dragons during feeding sessions to 
          share a carcass, or during mating season to fight over, and find suitible mates. Komodo Dragons are ectothermic, regulating
          their body heat through surrounding tempertures. They prefer hot and dry places, and are partial to dry, open grassland, 
          savanna, and tropical forest areas on the Indonesian islands. They are most active during the day, resting during the hottest
          parts of the afternoon, with little activity after dark. </p>
          <p class="lead">
            Komodo Dragons are rarely hostile toward humans. Though incidents and attacks on humans have been occasionally recorded, they are rare, with the
            animals usually only attacking if provoked or threatened. Komodos are typically non-aggressive, passive, or indifferent to humans
            so long as they keep their distance. Komodo dragons are considered endangered, mostly due to the fact that they are 
            found in such a limited area on the planet. In captivety, Komodo Dragons have displayed a wide variety of behaviors.
            Most in captivity have become reletively tame and accustome to their handlers, some
            have learned to recognize certain humans based on scent, sight, and sounds. Komodo dragons in captivity have been
            found to display "playing-behaviors" with various objects in their enclosures. An incident occured involving a Komodo
            Dragon in captivity back in 2001, when Phil Bronstein was injured after entering a Komodo Dragon enclosure at the L.A. Zoo.
            Although he escaped, Bronstein needed surgery to reattach tendons in his foot.
